This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app.  The build process fails with an error related to the Android SDK build tools version.  The error message may vary, but it typically indicates an incompatibility between the Expo CLI's requirements and the version installed on your system.  For example, you might see errors like "build tools version not found" or "Android SDK build-tools 30.0.3 is missing".  The problem often stems from an outdated or missing build-tools version.  The Expo CLI may require a specific version that doesn't match what's present in your Android SDK installation. This can also happen even after installing the necessary SDK components as there is a mismatch in the version required and the versions installed.
